if you haven't heard of Neo I'll tell you now 
keep your eyes out for this company
this is a Chinese eveve startup 
that's often referred to as China's Tesla
but actually it's much more than that

but actually it's much more than that it offers something no American EV maker currently offers and that's a quick stop battery swap so you don't have to recharge your EV recently Neo announced that it completed tis 30 millionth battery swap today I'll tell you how fast Neo achieved this Milestone what this means and why Tesla should be concerned move over Tesla because this might be the one one way  I may possibly consiber buying an

EV by the way a lot of time in research was done to put together this video and I really want to know what you think so
